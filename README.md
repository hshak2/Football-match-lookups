# Football Match Lookups
Type a football team in the world in both search bars and and if these two teams played against each other, find out what the score was or if they have any future games scheduled.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilized a public API to deliver results that are rendered to the document. Used JavaScript and HTML/CSS to make a mobile-first website.

## Lessons Learned:

I was able to get the API working well, but had difficulty making sure the media queries were functioning properly. Currently still have to work through the content decisions and make it look better on all screen sizes. I plan to work through it once more when I have more time to get it done.
