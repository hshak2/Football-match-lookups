## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Utilized a public API to deliver results that are rendered to the document. Used JavaScript and HTML/CSS to make a mobile-first website.

## Lessons Learned:

I initially had difficulty formatting the API in such a way that it would accept the results that were taken from the input element. Checking the documnentation and utilizing Postman to see what values were being given provided me with the best way to get this site functioning.
